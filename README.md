Hello, my name is Riley. I'm working on becoming a web developer through The Odin Project. They tasked me with an assignment to create a main index page with links to a few receipes. I'm a little nervous, but I'm really enjoying the process so far! I've been working with the command line and HTML. I'm not really sure what I'm doing with Git right now, but hey, it'll come in time. Well, time to jump in!
